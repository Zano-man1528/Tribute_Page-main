                <li class="blueNeonGlow pulsate">
                    1959 - Born in Sapporo, Iwata expressed interest in video
                    games from an early age and created his first simple game
                    while in high school. He majored in computer science at the
                    Tokyo Institute of Technology.
                </li>
                <li class="blueNeonGlow pulsate">
                    1980 - He joined the game developer HAL Laboratory while
                    attending the university. At HAL, he worked as a programmer
                    and closely collaborated with Nintendo, producing his first
                    commercial game in 1983
                </li>
                <li class="blueNeonGlow pulsate">
                    1993 - Following a downturn and near-bankruptcy, Iwata
                    became the president of HAL, at the insistence of Nintendo
                    president Hiroshi Yamauchi and brought financial stability
                </li>
                <li class="blueNeonGlow pulsate">
                    2000 and 2002 - Iwata joined Nintendo as the head of its
                    corporate planning division in 2000. Nintendo saw growth
                    under Iwata and, when Yamauchi retired, he became the
                    company's president in May 2002.
                </li>
                <li class="blueNeonGlow pulsate">
                    Under Iwata's direction, Nintendo developed the Nintendo DS
                    and Wii game consoles, helping the company achieve financial
                    success.
                </li>
                <li class="blueNeonGlow pulsate">
                    2009 - As a self-declared gamer, he focused on expanding the
                    appeal of video games across demographics through a "blue
                    ocean" business strategy. Nintendo attained record profits
                    by 2009, and Barron's placed Iwata among the top 30 CEOs
                    worldwide.
                </li>
                <li class="blueNeonGlow pulsate">
                    2009 and 2012 - Later hardware such as the Nintendo 3DS and
                    Wii U proved far less profitable than the Wii, and
                    Nintendo's net sales fell by two thirds.
                </li>
                <li class="blueNeonGlow pulsate">
                    2011 2014 and 2015 - Iwata voluntarily halved his salary. In
                    , after several years of refusal, Iwata put a portion of
                    Nintendo's focus into the rapidly growing mobile game
                    market.
                </li>
                <li class="blueNeonGlow pulsate">
                    In June 2014, a tumor in Iwata's bile duct was discovered
                    during a routine physical exam. It was removed, and Iwata
                    returned to work in October of that year. The problem
                    resurfaced in 2015, and Iwata died at the age of 55 from its
                    complications on July 11.
                </li>
                <li class="blueNeonGlow pulsate">
                    Members of the gaming industry and fans alike offered
                    tributes through public announcements and social media, and
                    fans worldwide established temporary memorials. Iwata was
                    posthumously awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the
                    2015 Golden Joystick Awards.
